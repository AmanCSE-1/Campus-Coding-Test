'''Once a upon a time in mumbai, there were two friends name Rahul and Rohan they both were very smart in coding. 
   They usually comes with a optimise solution of every problem they solve. 
   As Claimed by Rahul and Rohan of mumbai, a number is called perfect if it is of the form (3040*(10^k)) for integer K â‰¥0.
   Some of the good numbers are: 3040,304000,30400000.
   
   
   POGO gives you a number N and askes you whether, the given number can be represented as a sum of perfect numbers.
   Your task is to calculate or compute the minimum number of perfect-numbers required for that.'''
